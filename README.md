# Gratuity - Quick Tips

Gratuity for Apple Watch and iOS makes getting a tip at a restaurant quick and easy. Gratuity for iOS is the most beautiful and the most interactive tip calculator you have used. Gratuity for Apple Watch means you can calculate restaurant tips without even taking your phone out of your pocket.

Gratuity was my first Swift app. Its 100% written by me, 100% written in Swift, and is no longer under development.

## Why GPL License?

I want Gratuity to be open source but I don't want people to republish the app with a different name on the App Store. Please do not fork this project and submit to the App Store under your own account. The GPL requires that you give the original developer credit and it also requires that the modified app also be open source. So please don't do this.

Gratuity is a full application, not a library. The code is not generic enough to be a separate library. Also, this code is old and represents a point in time when I was much more junior. Please do not look at this code for reference or for judgement on my abilities as an iOS Developer.

I want all people that participate in issues, comments, pull requests, or any other part of the project to feel safe from harassment. Every person must treat every other person with respect and dignity or else face banning from the community.
