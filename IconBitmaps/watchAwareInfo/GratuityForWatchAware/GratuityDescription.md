## Description
- Gratuity for Apple Watch is the fastest and easiest way to calculate a tip at a restaurant. Gratuity on your wrist means you don’t need to get your phone out of the your pocket. The dark red color scheme is perfect for the romantic lighting in a restaurant. 

- Instead of trying to cram a small keypad onto the watch, Gratuity has been designed to take advantage of the Digital Crown. Spinning the Digital Crown allows you to quickly find and choose the Bill. After choosing the Bill, Gratuity recommends a Tip and gives you options above and below that recommendation.

### Description
- My name is Jeff. I’m a professional designer. I like making apps in my spare time, usually on Saturdays. The many examples of tip calculators on the App Store didn’t match the tipping paradigm I used in restaurants, so I made Gratuity for iOS. I’m really excited to release Gratuity for Apple Watch and bring this tipping paradigm to an exciting new platform.
